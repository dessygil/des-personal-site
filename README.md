# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

for the API I downloaded mongoose, dotenv, multer, express, nodemon

git subtree push --prefix api heroku master to push any backend changes to the github repository 


#THINGS LEFT TO DO NOW

- make the full card be the link
- make site https
- fix all npm high severity errors
- work on making an experience part
- add a footer with information from github make apollo better
- build out experience
  

#THINGS LEFT TO DO LATER
- make all css consistent naming style
- have button to bring to blog page at home page
- top list resume could be better put together the a tag inside the div have the exact same 
- website can be pulled from github so I can add a link to github projects that are being hosted
- find way to make css more global (buttons and margin top between sections on home page)
- change everything to typescript
- add date created to posts and projects and maybe an image for the blog posts
- get rid of numbers
- might be worth getting rid of backend
- start a new branch to change it to typescript
